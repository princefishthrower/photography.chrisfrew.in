        comment: 'In late November, I took a trip up to Alberschwende in Bregenzerwald to scout out some nice blue hour photos. The snow was coming down more heavily than I expected, making many opportunities challenging, as viisiblily, then, only minutes before catching the bus down to the valley, I encountered this amazing street just begging for shot. At this particular moment the snow was lighter than it had been and I was able to shoot not only the street, but the cozy farmhouses on the hills in the distance.',

        comment: 'Weather was less than optimal this Christmas Eve. It was rather warm which was creating a foggy haze among the fields - even up to 4000ft and higher. I set a long delay and captured this emotional picture with a few last minute travelers heading home for the holiday.',

        comment: 'After nearly a week of continual snowing, the Rhine valley saw some of the most snow at the valley level it had seen in years. I got up around 6AM and walked up to a street with a good view in Feldkirch, capturing this show in the blue hour of dawn.',
